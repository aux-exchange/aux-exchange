# Concentrated Liquidity AMM

This provide the mathematical process for concentrated liquidity on [aux exchange](https://aux.exchange), modelled partially on Uniswap's implementation.

## Constant Product AMM with Fee

### Pool State Before and After Swap

Constant product AMM is very straight forward, the reserves of the pool for two coins, $x$ and $y$ are required to be

$$
xy=C
$$

Pool also has an indicative price $p$, which is

$$
p = \frac{x}{y}
$$

Pool state ($x$ and $y$) can also be defined as $C$ and $p$:

$$
x = \sqrt{Cp}
$$

$$
y = \sqrt{C/p}
$$

To swap $\Delta x$ for $\Delta y$, the invariant must hold

$$
\left(x + \Delta x\right)\left(y - \Delta y\right) = C
$$

However, to encourage liquidity provision, liquidity provider must be provided a fee: $f$ Now the following must hold

$$
\left(x + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x\right)\left(y-\Delta y\right) = C
$$

After swap, $y$ is decreased to

$$
y^\ast=\frac{xy}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{Cp}+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x}
$$

The amount $\Delta y$ (the amount of $y$ that the user swapped from the pool)

$$
\Delta y = y - y^\ast = \frac{\left(1-f\right)\Delta x}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x}y =  \frac{\left(1-f\right)\Delta x}{\sqrt{Cp}+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x}\sqrt{C/p}
$$

Trivially, $x$ is increased to

$$
x^\ast=x+\Delta x = \sqrt{Cp} + \Delta x
$$

After the swap, $C$ is increased due to the fee $f$

$$
{C^\ast} = {{x}^\ast} {{y}^\ast}=\frac{x+\Delta x}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x} xy = C\frac{\sqrt{Cp}+\Delta x}{\sqrt{Cp}+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x}
$$

and finally $p$ after swap - pool indicative price is higher than without fee.

$$
p^\ast = \frac{x^\ast}{y^\ast} = \frac{\left(x+\Delta x\right)\left(x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x\right)}{xy} = \frac{\left(\sqrt{Cp}+\Delta x\right)\left(\sqrt{Cp}+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x\right)}{C}
$$

### Calculate required input amount for a given output

Sometimes the user has a specific $\Delta y$ to target, the required amount $\Delta x$ is

$$
\Delta x = \frac{\Delta y}{\left(y-\Delta y\right)\left(1-f\right)} x = \frac{\Delta y}{\left(1-f\right)\left(\sqrt{C/p}-\Delta y\right)}\sqrt{Cp}
$$

$$
x^\ast = x + \Delta x = \frac{\left(1-f\right)y-f\Delta y}{\left(y-\Delta y\right)\left(1-f\right)} x = \frac{\left(1-f\right)\sqrt{C/p}-f\Delta y}{\left(\sqrt{C/p}-\Delta y\right)\left(1-f\right)}\sqrt{Cp}
$$

$$
C^\ast = x^\ast y^\ast = \frac{\left(1-f\right)y-f\Delta y}{1-f} x = \frac{\left(1-f\right)\sqrt{C/p}-f\Delta y}{1-f} \sqrt{Cp}
$$

$$
p^\ast=\frac{\left(1-f\right)y-f\Delta y}{\left(y-\Delta y\right)^2\left(1-f\right)} x=\frac{\left(1-f\right)\sqrt{C/p}-f\Delta y}{\left(\sqrt{C/p}-\Delta y\right)^2\left(1-f\right)} \sqrt{Cp}
$$

### Two Swaps

If two swaps are done in place of one, $\Delta x = \Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2$

$$
{y^\ast}_1 = \frac{xy}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1}
$$

$$
\Delta y_1 = \frac{\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1} y
$$

$$
{y^\ast}_2 = \frac{\left(x+\Delta x_1\right){y^\ast}_1}{x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2} = \frac{xy}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1} \frac{x+\Delta x_1}{x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2}
$$

$$
\Delta y_2 =\frac{ \left(1-f\right) \Delta x_2 }{x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2} y^\ast_1 = \frac{ \left(1-f\right) \Delta x_2 }{x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2} \frac{xy}{x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1}
$$

and total amount $\Delta y$ is

$$
\Delta y = \Delta y_1 + \Delta y_2 = \frac{\left[x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1\right]\left[x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2\right] - x \left(x+\Delta x_1\right)}{\left[x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1\right]\left[x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2\right]} y = \frac{\left(1-f\right)\left[\Delta x_1 \left(x + \Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2\left(1-f\right)\right) + x\Delta x_2\right]}{\left[x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1\right]\left[x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2\right]}y
$$

If we swap for $\Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2$ directly

$$
\Delta y = \frac{\left(1-f\right)\left(\Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2\right)}{x+\left(1-f\right)\left(\Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2\right)}y
$$

and

$$
\frac{\left(1-f\right)\left(\Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2\right)}{x+\left(1-f\right)\left(\Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2\right)}y - \Delta y_1 - \Delta y_2 = \frac{f\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1 \Delta x_2 x y}{\left[x+\left(1-f\right)\Delta x_1\right]\left[x+\Delta x_1 + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x_2\right]\left[x+\left(1-f\right)\left(\Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2\right)\right]} > 0
$$

which means swapping one time is always better than swapping multiple times if there is a fee.

## Concentrated Liquidity

### Invariant

Let $x$ and $y$ are the virtual reserves, and they form the constant product invariant.
Let the real reserve be $x'$ and $y'$

$$
x = x' + \sqrt{Cp_l}
$$

$$
y = y' + \sqrt{\frac{C}{p_h}}
$$

where $p_l$ is the lower bound price of the pool, and $p_h$ is the upper bound price of the pool.

When $x'=0$, the pool only contains $y$ and price as indicated by the pool is at its lower bound, therefore

$$
x = \sqrt{Cp_l}
$$

$$
y = \sqrt{\frac{C}{p_l}}
$$

$$
y' = \sqrt{\frac{C}{p_l}} - \sqrt{\frac{C}{p_h}}
$$

Similarly, when $y'=0$, the pool only contains $x$ and the price as indicated pool is at its upper bound, therefore

$$
x = \sqrt{Cp_h}
$$

$$
x' = \sqrt{Cp_h} - \sqrt{Cp_l}
$$

$$
y = \sqrt{\frac{C}{p_h}}
$$

$p_l$ and $p_h$ are the parameters of the pool, and $C$ is an indication of how much reserves there are in the pool

### Pool Initialization without Predefined Price

For a given $p_l$ and $p_h$, and $x'$ and $y'$ are added to an empty pool, a $C$ needs to be calculated, which will also establish the pool indicative price $p$, we have

$$
x' = \sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{p} - \sqrt{p_l}\right)
$$

$$
y' = \sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{1/p} - \sqrt{1/p_h}\right)
$$

We can now solve for $C$ and $p$.

When $y'=0$, the price must be at the upper bound

$$
p = p_h
$$

$$
\sqrt{C} = \frac{x'}{\sqrt{p_h}-\sqrt{p_l}}
$$

when $x'=0$, the price must be at the lower bound

$$
p = p_l
$$

$$
\sqrt{C} = \frac{y'}{\sqrt{1/p_l}-\sqrt{1/p_h}}
$$

With both of $x'$ and $y'$ non-zero

$$
\frac{x'}{y'} \left(\sqrt{1/p} - \sqrt{1/p_h}\right) = \sqrt{p} - \sqrt{p_l} \Rightarrow p  +\left( \frac{x'}{y'} \sqrt{1/p_h} - \sqrt{p_l}\right)\sqrt{p} - \frac{x'}{y'}
$$

The above equation has two solutions, but only one of them is greater than 0 (notice the constant term $x'/y' > 0$), and

$$
\sqrt{p} =  \frac{\sqrt{p_l}}{2} - \frac{x'}{2y'}\sqrt{1/p_h} +\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{x'^2}{y'^2p_h}+p_l-\frac{2x'}{y'}\sqrt\frac{p_l}{p_h} + \frac{4x'}{y'}}
$$

And for $C$

$$
\sqrt{C} = \frac{1}{-\frac{\sqrt{p_l}}{2}-\frac{x'}{2y'\sqrt{p_h}}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{x'^2}{y'^2p_h}+p_l-\frac{2x'}{y'}\sqrt\frac{p_l}{p_h} + \frac{4x'}{y'}}}x' =\frac{2x'y'\sqrt{p_h}}{-y'\sqrt{p_lp_h}-x'+\sqrt{x'^2+p_lp_hy'^2-2x'y'\sqrt{p_lp_h}+4x'y'p_h}}
$$

Notice that if we set $p_h$ to $+\infty$ and $p_l$ to 0, the form of $p$ and $C$ will reduce to vanilla constant product amm.

Since terms $C$ and $p$ showing up mostly as their squre roots $\sqrt{C}$ and $\sqrt{p}$, we will express the pool states with those instead.

### Numerical Solution

$\sqrt{p}$ and $\sqrt{C}$ can also be solved numerically

For Newton Raphson method:

$$
f = \sqrt{p}^2 - \sqrt{p_l}\sqrt{p} - \frac{x'}{y'}\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{p}}{\sqrt{p_h}}\right)
$$

$$
\frac{df}{d\sqrt{p}} = 2\sqrt{p} - \sqrt{p_l} +\frac{x'}{y'}\frac{1}{\sqrt{p_h}}
$$

and

$$
\sqrt{p}^\ast = \sqrt{p} - \frac{f\left(\sqrt{p}\right)}{df/d\sqrt{p}} = \frac{\sqrt{p}^2+\frac{x'}{y'}}{2\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_l}+\frac{x'}{y'}\frac{1}{\sqrt{p_h}}}
$$

Given $p$ is bounded by $p_l$ and $p_h$, binary search method can also be used.

### Pool Initialization with Predefined Price

If the price $p$ is already established, we have

$$
\sqrt{C} = \text{min}\left(\frac{x'}{\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_l}},\frac{y'}{\sqrt{1/p}-\sqrt{1/p_h}}\right)
$$

## Swap with Concentrated Liquidity

### Unchanged Virtual Reserve with Fee

If the swap doesn't push the price out of $\left(p_l, p_h\right)$, the formulation is exactly the same as constant product. Given swap quantity $\Delta x$, we have

$$
C^\ast = \frac{\sqrt{Cp} + \Delta x}{\sqrt{Cp} + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x} C
$$

$$
p^\ast = \frac{\left(\sqrt{Cp} + \Delta x\right)^2}{C^\ast}=\frac{\left(\sqrt{Cp} + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x\right)\left(\sqrt{Cp} + \Delta x\right)}{C}
$$

Assuming pool current is at $C$ and $p$, the maximum $y$ amount that can be swapped for is simply the entire reserve

$$
\Delta y_m = \sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{1/p} - \sqrt{1/p_h}\right)
$$

$$
y^\ast_m = \sqrt{C/p_h}, \quad y'^\ast_m=0
$$

$$
\Delta x_m = \frac{\sqrt{C}}{1-f}\left(\sqrt{p_h}-\sqrt{p}\right)
$$

$$
x^\ast_m = \frac{\sqrt{C}}{1-f}\left(\sqrt{p_h}-f\sqrt{p}\right), \quad x'^\ast_m=\frac{\sqrt{C}}{1-f}\left(\sqrt{p_h}-f\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_l}\left(1-f\right)\right)
$$

$$
C^\ast_m = x^\ast_my^\ast_m = C\frac{1-f\sqrt{p/p_h}}{1-f}
$$

$$
p^\ast_m = x^\ast_m/y^\ast_m = \frac{p_h}{1-f}\left(1-f\sqrt\frac{p}{p_h}\right)
$$

Notice the last equation shows the price of the pool when $y$ is exhausted is actually slighter higher than $p_h$. This is expected because $C^*$ is increasing due to fee, and the virtual reserves are not adjusted to account for that. However, $f$ is generally very small, and if spacing of the $p_l$ and $p_h$ are small, which makes $\sqrt{p/p_h} \sim 1$, so the final price of the pool is very close to $p_h$.

When $y$ is exhausted, we can readjust $C$ to

$$
\sqrt{C}=\frac{x'}{\sqrt{p_h}-\sqrt{p_l}}
$$

### Readjust After Each Swap with Fee

The existence of fee makes $C$ increase, and the price range the pool will expand. Just like when the pool exhausted liquidity, $C$ and $p$ can be readjusted to restore the price band to $p_l$ and $p_h$.

Recall that

$$
x'=\sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_l}\right)
$$

$$
y'=\sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{1/p}-\sqrt{1/p_h}\right)
$$

After the swap, the reserves become

$$
\sqrt{C^\ast}\left(\sqrt{p^\ast}-\sqrt{p_l}\right)=x'=\sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_l}\right) + \Delta x
$$

$$
\sqrt{C^\ast}\left(\sqrt{1/p^\ast}-\sqrt{1/p_h}\right)=y'=\frac{C}{\sqrt{Cp} + \left(1-f\right)\Delta x} - \sqrt{C/p_h}
$$

And we can solve for the new $C$ and $p$.

### Excluding Fee from the Pool

Another way to return fee to liquidity provider is move fee into a separate tracking structure (such as the `aux::reward_dsitributor`). This way $C$ doesn't change after swap.

$$
y' = \frac{C}{\sqrt{Cp} + \Delta x} - \sqrt{C/p_h}
$$

$$
\Delta y = \frac{C}{\sqrt{Cp}} - \frac{C}{\sqrt{Cp} + \Delta x}
$$

## Integer Math

### Ticks

Given price bands always appear in square root, we use square price instead of the price itself. Further we require that

$$
p\left(i\right) = 1.0001^{i}
$$

where $i$ is the tick index. So the square price is

$$
\sqrt{p\left(i\right)} = \sqrt{1.0001^i}
$$

We are going to use 128-bit unsigned integer as fixed point number for square price and liquidity $\sqrt{C}$. If the value is $d$, the represented fixed point value is $\frac{d}{2^{64}}$. And because square price has 64 bit after decimal point, price will have 128 bit after the point and must be stored in `u256`;

All coins in aptos or sui are bounded by `u64`, the max price is therefore $2^{64}-1=18446744073709551615$, and the max tick $i$ is bounded by

$$
\frac{\text{ln}\left(2^{64}-1\right)}{\text{ln}\left(1.0001\right)}\approx 443636.4 < 2^{19} = 524288
$$

The smallest price possible is $1/2^{64}$, and the min tick $i$ is

$$
\frac{\text{ln}\left(1/2^{64}\right)}{\text{ln}\left(1.0001\right)} \approx - 443636.4 \Rightarrow i < -2^{19} = -524288
$$

### From Tick to Square Price

From a tick index $i$, the price is simply $1.0001^i$ and square price $1.0001^{i/2}$. Provided that $\left|i\right| < 19$, the exponential term can be calculate with at most 19 multiplications

$$
q^i = \prod_j q_j
$$

for $i>0$ and $i \leq 443636$

$$
q_j = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1 & 2^j \& i = 0 \\
q^{2^j} & 2^j\& i > 0
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

All $\sqrt{1.0001}^{2^j}$ for $j$ between 0 and 18 are precalculated.

and for $i<0$ and $i \geq -443636$

$$
q_j = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & 2^j \& (-i) = 0 \\
\frac{1}{q^{2^j}} & 2^j \& (-i) > 0
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

All $\sqrt{1.0001}^{-2^j}$ for $j$ between 0 and 18 are precalculated.

Any $i$ outside $\left[-443636, 443636\right]$ will either overflow or underflow.

The calculations of $\sqrt{1.0001}^{2^n}$ are provided [here](./concliq/tick.go#L7-L41)

### From Square Price to Tick

From a price $p$, we need to find $i$ such that $\sqrt{1.0001}^{i} \leq \sqrt{p} \leq \sqrt{1.0001}^{i+1}$. Take binary logarithm

$$
i \log_{2}\sqrt{1.0001} \leq \log_2\sqrt{p} \leq \left(i+1\right)\log_{2}\sqrt{1.0001}
$$

or

$$
i=\left\lfloor \frac{\log_2 \sqrt{p}}{\log_2 \sqrt{1.0001}}\right\rfloor
$$

The problem reduces to calculating $\log_2 \sqrt{p}$ if $\log_2\sqrt{1.0001}$ is precalculated.

### Binary Logirithm

We are looking for $x/2^N=\log_2 y$ where $x$ is an integer and $N$ is desired precision.
Let $y$ be a fixed point number with 64 bits before and after decimal point, and it is stored in a 128 bit integer.

The method is as follows

- **Make sure** $1\leq y < 2$ - this can be checked by making sure there are exactly 63 leading zeros in $y$.

  If $y$ is not within $\left[1, 2\right)$, we can shift $y$ $n_0$ bits to be within that range

- Square $y$ $m$ times so that $y^{2^m}$ is within $\left[2, 4\right)$ (if this is fixed point with 128 bit integers, we will square the number - need to handle the overflow here - and right shift 64 bits). Let the result be $z=y^{2^m}$.

- Notice $\log_2 z = 2^m\log_2 y$, and

  $$
  \log_2 y = \frac{1}{2^m}\left(\log_2 \frac{z}{2} + 1\right)
  $$

  where $\frac{z}{2} \in \left[1, 2\right)$. Now we can reapply the same treat with new $y=\frac{z}{2}$.

Sum everything up

$$
\log_2 y = n_0 + \frac{1}{2^{m_1}}\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m_2}}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^{m_3}}\left(...\right)\right)\right)
$$

where $n_0\geq 0$ if $y \geq 2$ and $n_0 < 0 $ when $y<1$. However, move-lang doesn't support signed integers, and we do need special treatment when $n_0$ is added to the result.

### Tick Spacing

Pool also has a parameter **tick spacing**, which requires tick $i = nt$, where $t$ is tick spacing, and $n$ is an integer. This is for widening the price band when the asset price is highly volatile. The minimal $t$ is 1.

## Implementation

### Price Band

The pool is implemented as a linked list, with a pointer to the current active tick. Each node of the price band contains

- the lower tick
- tick spacing
- square root of lower price limit $\sqrt{p_l}$ and its inverse $1/\sqrt{p_l}$. Note the sqrt price is obtained from the tick, and its inverse is obtained from the negative of the tick.
- square root of upper price limit $\sqrt{p_h}$ and its inverse $1/\sqrt{p_h}$. Similarly, the square price and its inverse are obtained directly from tick and negative tick.
- total liquidity $\sqrt{C}$.

If the current reference sqrt price is $\sqrt{p}$, we require that if $\sqrt{p} \in \left[\sqrt{p_l},\sqrt{p_h}\right]$

$$
\sqrt{C}\left(\sqrt{p} -\sqrt{p_l}\right) \leq x'
$$

$$
\sqrt{C}\left(1/\sqrt{p} - 1/\sqrt{p_h}\right) \leq y'
$$

Therefore

$$
\sqrt{C} = \text{min}\left(\frac{x'}{\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_l}},\frac{y'}{1/\sqrt{p}-1/\sqrt{p_h}}\right)
$$

Since $\sqrt{C}$ and $\sqrt{p}$ both have 64 bits after decimal point, $x'$ and $y'$ must be raised to have 128 bits after decimal point.

**The above is used to calculate lp token amount for the adding liquidity to the band.**

### Adding liquidity

If the pool doesn't have a reference price, or the reference price is in a region that the pool cannot represent (for example, the pool liquidity is exhausted on one side, but the next tick is empty, and the swap user didn't cross the tick), the user must specify a reference price, together with the lower tick $t-$ and upper tick $t+$. The added liquidity will be

$$
\sqrt{C} = \text{min}\left(\frac{x'}{\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p_{l_{t-}}}},\frac{y'}{1/\sqrt{p}-1/\sqrt{p_{h_{t+}}}}\right)
$$

### Removing liquidity

The removal amount is

$$
\Delta x' = \frac{\Delta \sqrt{C} x'}{\sqrt{C}}
$$

$$
\Delta y' = \frac{\Delta \sqrt{C} y'}{\sqrt{C}}
$$

Integer division always round down.

### Swap with specified input amount

If the input amount is specified

$$
\sqrt{p^\ast} = \left\lceil\frac{x'+\Delta x}{\sqrt{C}}\right\rceil + \sqrt{p_l}
$$

$$
\Delta y' = \sqrt{C}\left(\left\lfloor 1/\sqrt{p^\ast}\right\rfloor - \sqrt{1/p}\right)
$$

We also need to make sure $\sqrt{p^\ast} \leq \sqrt{p_h}$ and $1/\sqrt{p^\ast}\geq 1/\sqrt{p_h}$
