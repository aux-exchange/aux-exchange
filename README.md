# AUX

## ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Status Update March 17, 2023

We have decided to cease the development on [aux.exchange](https://aux.exchange). It has been a fun ride and we are honored to be part of amazing aptos community.

We will leave the website up for a while, there is also instruction at the end of the README to run the website on your own. Feel free to poke around the codes, and have fun!

## Introduction

AUX is a decentralized exchange powered by Aptos. We support the following
features:

- Liquidity pools (AMM)
- Central limit order book (CLOB)
- Router for best execution between AMM and CLOB

## Fees and Rebates

- Liquidity pool fees are set by the pool creator. AUX expects fees to range from
  0 bps to 30 bps. All fees are retained by the liquidity providers.
- Central limit order book fees are 0 bps for both maker and taker sides.
- The AUX router does not charge any fees on top of the underlying liquidity pool
  or central limit order book fees.

## Start Trading

Navigate to our [web app](https://aux.exchange) to start trading.

## Aptos

### Typescript SDK

We provide a typescript SDK for AUX exchange on Aptos. Also known as `aux-ts`.

See [`aptos/api/aux-ts/examples`](./aptos/api/aux-ts/examples) for examples of interacting
with the AMM and CLOB through typescript.

In particular, we recommend starting with `devnet-amm-instructions.ts`.

## Run a local version of the UI

The web app of aux.exchange is a pure client side web application, located at [firebase/hosting/swap-trading](./firebase/hosting/swap-trading).

The UI can be launched by any standard web server that can serve static files. An example in golang is provided at [here](./firebase/hosting/swap-trading/serve.go).

The golang example can also be run directly if golang>=1.19 is setup:

```sh
go run github.com/aux-exchange/aux-exchange/firebase/hosting/swap-trading@latest
```

The default port is 5173, which can be changed by `-port` option.
